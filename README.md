## About

This project was created using React and AWS Amplify for the [SCEGGRAPH SJSU Hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/social-bullet).

Social Bullet is an application that digitizes the goal-oriented experience of a bullet journal. It not only allows you to create and keep track of personal projects, but it connects you with others who have similar goals. With Social Bullet, users can motivate themselves and others to do projects and accomplish goals.
